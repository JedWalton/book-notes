>Design and Deploy Production-Ready Software

By Michael T. Nygard.

## Chapter 1. Living in Production
### Aiming for the Right Target
* We need to design individual software systems, and the whole ecosystem of interdependent systems, to operate at low cost and high quality.

### The Scope of the Challenge
* The increasing scope of this challenge —to build software fast that’s cheap to build, good for users, and cheap to operate— demands continually improving architecture and design techniques. Designs appropriate for small WordPress websites fail outrageously when applied to large scale, transactional, distributed systems, and we’ll look at some of those outrageous failures.

### A Million Dollars Here, a Million Dollars There
* Design and architecture decisions are also financial decisions.
* These choices must be made with an eye toward their implementation cost as well as their downstream costs.

### Use the Force
* Your early decisions make the biggest impact on the eventual shape of your system.
* The earliest decisions you make can be the hardest ones to reverse later.
* The beginning is when your team is most ignorant of the eventual structure of the software, yet that’s when some of the most irrevocable decisions must be made.

### Pragmatic Architecture
* The ivory-tower architect most enjoys an end-state vision of ringing crystal perfection, but the pragmatic architect constantly thinks about the dynamics of change.

* Software delivers its value in production. The development project, testing, integration, and planning...everything before production is prelude.
